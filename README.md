👋 Hi, I’m Lettie
👀 I have proficiency and working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am interested in web design and creating user-centred designs for digital products 
   that improve the user experience. 
🌱 I’m currently a junior project manager & data analyst. I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering as well as the Google Project Management 
   Certificate, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certificate.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve web and UI/UX Design.
