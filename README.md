Hi, I’m Lettie.
I have proficiency and working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am interested in web design and creating user-centred designs for digital products 
   that improve the user experience. 
I’m currently a junior project manager & data analyst. I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, as well as the Google Project Management 
   Certificate, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certificate.
I’m looking to collaborate on web and UI/UX Design projects.
